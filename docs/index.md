## Why This Cookbook?

!!! success "Battle-tested patterns"

    Every pattern in this cookbook is based on real-world, production-ready Terraform modules from the **terraform-aws-modules** organization. You're getting infrastructure code that has been used and validated by thousands of developers.

!!! info "Comprehensive coverage"

    From simple Lambda functions to complex event-driven architectures, we cover all the essential AWS serverless services with practical examples and best practices.

!!! tip "Developer-friendly"

    Each pattern includes complete Terraform code, architecture diagrams, usage examples, and clear explanations of when and how to use each pattern.

## Quick Start Example

Here's a taste of what you'll find in this cookbook - a simple serverless API:

```terraform title="main.tf"
module "lambda_api" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-api"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs20.x"
  source_path   = "./src"

  # API Gateway integration
  create_lambda_function_url = true
  cors = {
    allow_credentials = false
    allow_origins     = ["*"]
    allow_methods     = ["*"]
    allow_headers     = ["date", "keep-alive"]
    expose_headers    = ["date", "keep-alive"]
    max_age          = 86400
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "my-serverless-api"
  }
}
```
